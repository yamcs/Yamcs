/**
 * Used when referencing a directory style "NameType".
 *  All characters are legal.
 *  All name references use a Unix ‘like’ name referencing mechanism across the SpaceSystem Tree
 *   (e.g., SimpleSat/Bus/EPDS/BatteryOne/Voltage) where the '/', ‘..’ and ‘.’ are used to navigate through the 
 *   hierarchy.  The use of an unqualified name will search for an item in the current SpaceSystem first, then 
 *   if none is found, in progressively higher SpaceSystems.  A SpaceSystem is a name space (i.e., a named type 
 *   declared in MetaCommandData is also declared in TelemetryMetaData - and vice versa).
 *
 *   This is used only while reading the database, then all the references are resolved and we use 
 *   Java references to real objects
 *   
 *    The ResolvAction.resolv will be called once the reference is resolved in {@link: org.yamcs.xtce.XtceDb}

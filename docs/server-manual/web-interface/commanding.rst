Commanding
==========

The Commanding group within the Yamcs web interface provides access to commanding pages.


Send a command
--------------

The Send a command page provides access to every command specified for the current Yamcs instance.
A command can be selected, configured, and sent now or scheduled to be sent later. 


Command stack
-------------

The Command stack page allows users to create and edit command stacks.
Command stacks define a sequence of configured existing commands to be sent, with a progression rule.
Progression rules combine a condition based on the status of the previous command (Queued, Released, Sent, Completed) and a delay.
Command stacks can be sent now or scheduled to be sent later. 


Command history
---------------

The Command history page shows the list of previously sent commands, with status information. 
Arguments and return value can be displayed. A report can be viewed for each command.


Queues
------

The Queues page shows the status of command queues.

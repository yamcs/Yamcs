Activities
==========

The Activities page shows a list of all activities that are ongoing or completed, sorted by time.
Each activity on the list shows a status icon, indicating whether the activity was/is Successful, Failed, Canceled or Ongoing.
When at least one activity is ongoing, a label on the Activities navigation button shows the number of ongoing activities.
Ongoing activities can be canceled from the list.
An activity's ID can be clicked to view its log, which includes the script output if the activity ran a script.

Activities can either be manual or managed by Yamcs.
Ongoing manual activities on the list provide buttons for the user to set them `Successful` or `Failed`.
New manual activities starting immediately can be defined by pressing the `New activity` button.
New scheduled manual activities can be created from the Timeline Chart or Timeline Items pages.
New activities managed by Yamcs include scripts, which can be created and scheduled from the Procedures Run a script page.
